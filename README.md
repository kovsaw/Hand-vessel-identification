# Hand-vessel-identification
Project for identification and verification of people by the veins of the finger.

A study was conducted on the identification of the veins on the finger of the human hand.
During the project, the task was to receive and process a picture with a hand. To implement it, algorithms for creating a snapshot, finding a finger on a photo and veins in a finger, applying filters and algorithms for identifying an individual were applied.


## The project contains:
* neural network code,
* code hashing function,
* code filters in several variations,
* the code for adding photos and interacting with the machine,
* database.

First file - Veins_Project - is a neural network for finding fingers on photo.
